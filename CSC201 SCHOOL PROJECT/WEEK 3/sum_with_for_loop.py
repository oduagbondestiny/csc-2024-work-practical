#objective to write a program that uses for loop to find the some of number store is a list

# Define a list of numbers
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Initialize a variable to store the sum
sum_of_numbers = 0

# Iterate through the list using a for loop
for num in numbers:
    sum_of_numbers += num

# Print the sum of numbers
print("Sum of numbers in the list:", sum_of_numbers)
